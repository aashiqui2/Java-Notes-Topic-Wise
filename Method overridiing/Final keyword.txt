final:
We cannot override Final methods.
we cannot re-assign final methods.
we cannot extends final class.

private variable:same class Access,reassign
final variable:can be accessed from other classes,reassign not posssible anywhere.

private:

if atleast one method is abstract the entire class is abstract.

Parent2 is abstract; cannot be instantiated

instance-object

Inheritance:Child Object behaves as Parent Object

Abstraction:
Showing only necessary and hiding unwanted data

why do we need Abstarction

abstarct: overriding:inheritance:encapsulation
abstract method cannot be private

method overriding is runtime polymorphism
