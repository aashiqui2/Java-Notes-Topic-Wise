what is constructor?
constructor is useful for  initializing object specific values.
it is created using the same name of our class name.
constructor area is getting called automatically when object/instance  is created. [object--instance] [class is instantiated]
constructor doesnt have any return type.
Default constructor is invisible.
This default constructor will call the no-argument constructor of the superclass.
The compiler automatically provides a no-argument, default constructor for any class without constructors.
Once we overload constructor, it becomes visible.
once we have visible constructor,there is no,no-argument constructor.



Fields will be asigned with default values.
byte,short,int,long: 0
float,double: 0.0
boolean: false
char:''(empty)
String: null


This keyword:
it refer to the current object of same class.  
this can be used only inside non-static[object specific] area or context.
inside static blocks,static methods we cant use this keyword
